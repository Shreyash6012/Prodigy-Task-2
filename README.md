Create a Guessing Game
# 🎯 Guessing Game Program

## 📌 Task-02 | Prodigy Infotech

This project is part of **Task-02** assigned during my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.  
The objective of this task is to create an interactive **Guessing Game** that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number.

---

## 📝 Description

The Guessing Game program generates a random number within a specified range and asks the user to guess it.  
After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is **too high** or **too low**.  
The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, and then displays the **total number of attempts** taken.

## 🚀 How the Program Works

1. The program generates a random number.
2. The user enters their guess.
3. The program compares the guess with the generated number.
4. Feedback is shown:
   - Too High
   - Too Low
5. Steps repeat until the correct number is guessed.
6. Total attempts are displayed at the end.
